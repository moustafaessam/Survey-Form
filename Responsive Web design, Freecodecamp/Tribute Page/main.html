          <h3>His Career at Barcelona:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2003-05: Rise to the first team</li>
            <p>
              During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi
              rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record
              five teams in a single campaign.
            </p>
            <li>2005-08: Making the starting eleven</li>
            <p>
              On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first
              contract as a senior team player.
            </p>
            <li>2008-09: Winning the sextuple</li>
            <p>
              Barça's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as they
              became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six
              top-tier trophies in a single year.
            </p>
            <li>2010-11: Continued success</li>
            <p>
              At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World
              Player of the Year award, both times by the greatest voting margin
              in each trophy's history.
            </p>
            <li>2012: A record-breaking year</li>
            <p>
              20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history
              at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César
              Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.
            </p>
            <li>2013-14: Messidependence</li>
            <p>
              Barcelona lost 7-0 on aggregate to Bayern Munchen. These matches
              gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's
              perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star
              player.
            </p>
            <li>2015: A historic treble</li>
            <p>
              Messi capped off the year by opening the scoring in the 36th
              minute of the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December,
              collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona went on to
              defeat River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama, and winning the tournament's
              Silver Ball, despite missing the semi-final.
            </p>
            <li>2016: 5th Ballon d'Or</li>
            <p>
              Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his
              career.
